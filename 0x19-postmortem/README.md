*As was mentioned in the news yesterday, the famous fintech application that is used by more than 3 million african people was down for more than 10 hours. Today we hope to provide you with an incident report that details the nature of the outage and our response*

The following report is to breakdown what actually happend on the server side on March 29 of 2024. We would like to apologize for the fear and the bad experince that everyone have been through since it was announced that the server got down by outer source, as we know most users and workers in the company are effected.

### Issue Summary ###
From 6:30AM to 16:30PM, we encoundtred an issue from an outsource that clearly messed with the conficguration file that we use to automate our server work, and enhanced that by playing aournd with the data base so that he can transfer other people balances into his own. Around 6:28AM a user identifeied the problem when he couldn't log into his account, after contacting the support team it was identfied that his account was the one that the hacker was using to go into other people accounts. Other users could still regiester but they could have their account balance manuiplated and not correct for most of them in a precentage of about 45%. The prime use of this is an SQL injection techqniue that was used by the hacker
