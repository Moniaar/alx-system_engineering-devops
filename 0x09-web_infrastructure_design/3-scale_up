The additional new elemnts are:
The new added server to work in standby mode in case the other 2 servers modified by the clustering system isn't working or there was so much load applied to them.
The firewall and the monitoring system to the new server to help secure the system from future failure and keep track of developing it using the monitoring system.
The firewall will makw sure that your payload is matching to what you set it to be, and it will gurauntee a secure connection with the server.
The clustring system with the other server is to improve avaliability, by making sure your system is avaliable all times when requested. Spliting the compnents is better because
the security will be increased as well, and the ability to fix the system in case of a crash is greater than the compnents being all together. The load balancer will
work with both the clustring system and the server that is working alone to make sure that the load is well ditributed among both parts.
